This practical requires all questions from the last two practicals (on variography and kriging) to be answered. The database is the same, and focus is on the logarithm of the cadimum.

# Preamble 

```{r}
rm(list=ls()) #Clean the working directory
library(minigst)
```


## Loading the Meuse dataset

```{r loading_data_set}
library(sp) # load library
data(meuse) # load data
data(meuse.grid) # load target grid
names(meuse.grid)[5]="dist.m" # change the name to concur with meuse
```

Create the data Db

```{r loading_in_Db}

## Create Db from dataframe
data=dfToDb(meuse,coordnames = c("x","y"))

## Add log concentrations
var_name = c( "cadmium", "copper", "lead", "zinc")
addVarToDb(data,var=log(meuse[,var_name]),vname = paste0("log_",var_name))

# Plot the data
dbplot_point(data,size="log_cadmium",sizeRange = c(0.1,3), pointColor = "red",
             xlab = "Easting (m)", ylab = "Northing (m)", title = "Log Cadmium")

```

Create the target (grid) Db

```{r create the target (grid dB)}
target = dfToDbGrid(meuse.grid,coordnames = c('x','y'))

# Plot the distance to river in the target Db
dbplot_grid(target, color='dist.m',title='Distance to the river')
```

# Universal Kriging with gstlearn

## Model fitting: Variography and non-stationnarity

As usual, we start by fitting a model on our data (which are in the Db `data`). Since we wish to perform universal kriging, our variable of interest $Z(x)$ is modeled at any location $x$ as follows
$$ Z(x) = X(x)\beta + R(x) = \sum_{i=1}^p \beta_iX_i(x) +R(x)$$
where $X(x) = (X_1(x),...,X_p(x))$ is a row-vector containing the values of the $p$ drift functions at the location $x$, and $R$ is a zero-mean spatially correlated field of residuals. Universal kriging then consists on finding optimal weights to predict the value of $Z$ at a location $x_0$ using a weighted sum of observations $Z(x_1),...,Z(x_n)$, and given that the vector of coefficients $\beta$ is unknown.

Note that by optimal we mean that resulting predictor is unbiased, and has a minimal prediction error given some model on the covariance of the residuals $R$. Hence, in essence, universal kriging is just a generalization of ordinary kriging, but with a non-stationary mean defined by drift functions.

In this section, we will apply universal kriging to predict the value of the log-concentration of Cadmium (Variable `log_cadmium`) using the distance to the river (Variable `dist.m`) as a drift function. 


The first step of applying universal kriging is to estimate the covariance model of the residuals. This can be done using an experimental variogram of the residuals which can be computed using once again the function `vario_exp` but now specifying the argument `extDrift` to be the name(s) of the variable(s) we wish to use as drift(s). Note that when specifying an external drift, 

1. Compute an experimental variogram of the raw observations of `log_cadmium`, and then an experimental variogram of the residuals of `log_cadmium` when the distance to the river (`dist.m`) is used as a drift. Compare the resulting plots.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Experimental variogram on raw data: Use a omnidirectional with 40 lags of length 50
varioexp_raw = vario_exp(data,vname="log_cadmium",nlag=40, dlag=50)

# Experimental variogram on residuals with the same parameters
varioexp_res = vario_exp(data,vname="log_cadmium",
                                 extDrift = 'dist.m',nlag=40, dlag=50)
```


```{r, warning=FALSE}
# Side-by-side plots of the experimental variograms
p1 = plot_vario(varioexp_raw, pairDisplay = "size", title="Experimental variogram on raw data")
p2 = plot_vario(varioexp_res,  pairDisplay = "size",title="Experimental variogram on residuals")
ggarrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1,legend = "bottom",common.legend = TRUE)
```

When performing universal kriging, we need to fit a model on the residuals

2. Fit a model composed of a nugget effect and an exponential covariance to the experimental variogram of the residuals (discard the anisotropy)

```{r}
# Fitting the model
struct_names=c("NUGGET","EXPONENTIAL")
model_drift=model_fit(varioexp_res,extDrift = 'dist.m',struct=struct_names)
```

```{r}
# display of the model
model_drift$display() 

# plot of the experimental variogram and the fitted model
plot_vario(varioexp_res,model = model_drift,pairDisplay = "size",
           title="Model adjustment for cadmium residuals")

```

## Universal Kriging

To work with universal kriging or kriging with external drift, it suffices to call `minikriging` (to compute predictions) or `minixvalid` (to perform cross-validation) with  drift functions. Polynomial drift functions are specified by the argument `polDrift` argument, and external drift variables are specified by the argument `extDrift` argument. See the help of the function `minikriging` for more details.

3. Compute and plot the universal kriging predictions (and standard-deviations) on the target grid of the variable `log_cadmium` using the variable `dist.m` as a drift and the model fitted on the residuals. Use the Dbgrid `target` as target locations.

```{r}
## Perform universal kriging with a unique neighborhood, and use "UK" as a prefix
minikriging(data, target, vname = "log_cadmium", extDrift ='dist.m', 
            model = model_drift, prefix = "UK", neighborhood = "unique", std = TRUE)
```

```{r}
## Plot kriging estimate
p1=dbplot_grid(target, color='UK.log_cadmium.estim',title='Universal Kriging: Pred.',legendTitle = "Value")
## Plot kriging stdev
p2=dbplot_grid(target, color='UK.log_cadmium.stdev',title='Universal Kriging: Std-Dev',legendTitle = "Value")
## Side by side plot
ggarrange(p1,p2,nrow = 1)
```

## Cross-validation

We can perform cross-validation as demonstrated in the "Kriging" practical session, using the function `minixvalid` with the same arguments as the `minikriging` function (except for the the target Db).

4. Perform a cross-validation analysis on the universal kriging prediction defined in 3.

```{r}
## Cross-validation for universal kriging: Set the prefix
minixvalid(data, vname = "log_cadmium",  
                 model=model_drift, neighborhood = "unique", std = TRUE,prefix="Xvalid_UK")
```

Print plot the results of the cross-validation.

```{r}
## Plot histogram of cross-validation errors
xvalid_name="Xvalid_UK.log_cadmium.esterr"
plot_hist(data,vname=xvalid_name,nbin=30,color="blue",xlab="Estimation Errors", title="Cross-Validation")

## Print some statistics about the cross-validation errors
print(c("Mean cross-validation error:",mean(data[,xvalid_name], na.rm=TRUE)))
print(c("Mean squared cross-validation error:",mean(data[,xvalid_name]^2, na.rm=TRUE)))

p=dbplot_grid(target,color = "UK.log_cadmium.estim")
dbplot_point(data,size = xvalid_name, add=p)

```



## Comparison and interpretation

5. Compute an ordinary kriging prediction of `log_cadmium` (with a model fitted on the raw observations). Compare the results to the universal predictions using a cross-plot (-> `plot_scatter`), and by performing a cross-validation analysis on the ordinary kriging results and comparing the results to the ones obtained in 4.

```{r}
## Fit a model on the experimental variogram of the raw observations
model_raw = model_fit(varioexp_raw,struct=struct_names)

## Perform ordinary kriging with a unique neighborhood, and use "OK" as a prefix
minikriging(data, target, vname = "log_cadmium", type="ordinary",
            model = model_raw, prefix = "OK", neighborhood = "unique", std = TRUE)

```

```{r}
## Scatter plot Simple Kriging VS Ordinary Kriging: Predictions
plot_scatter(target,vnamex="OK.log_cadmium.estim",vnamey="UK.log_cadmium.estim",
              title="Kriging predictions: Ordinary vs, Universal", xlab="Ordinary Kriging", ylab="Universal Kriging",
             eqLine = TRUE)
```

```{r}
## Perform cross-validation analysis on the ordinary kriging predictor (use the prefix "Xvalid_OK")
minixvalid(data,vname = "log_cadmium", type="ordinary",
            model = model_raw, prefix = "Xvalid_OK", neighborhood = "unique", std = TRUE)
```


```{r}
## Plot histogram of cross-validation errors
xvalid_name="Xvalid_OK.log_cadmium.esterr"
plot_hist(data,vname=xvalid_name,nbin=30,color="blue",xlab="Estimation Errors", title="Cross-Validation")

## Print some statistics about the cross-validation errors
print(c("Mean cross-validation error:",mean(data[,xvalid_name], na.rm=TRUE)))
print(c("Mean squared cross-validation error:",mean(data[,xvalid_name]^2, na.rm=TRUE)))

p=dbplot_grid(target,color = "OK.log_cadmium.estim")
dbplot_point(data,size = xvalid_name, add=p)
```



## Adding other explanatory variables

We will try here to add *soil* and *ffreq*. Since those are categorical variables encoded as factors in the dataframes *meuse* and *meuse.grid*, we need to build the corresponding covariate vectors (1 less than the levels to avoid colinearity). To do this, let's consider the following piece of code:


```{r}
## Extract the categorical variables (stored as factors)
meuse_cat = meuse[,c("soil","ffreq")]

##' Create a new data frame containing the one-hot encoding of the variables `soil` and `ffreq`
##' The function model.matrix creates the one-hot encoding of variables specified (through a "formula") in the first arguments.
##'  Note that if a variable has n categories, then n-1 variables are created, and that the first column contains only ones and is automatically added by the function.
df_one_hot=data.frame(model.matrix(~soil+ffreq,data=meuse_cat))
df_one_hot=df_one_hot[,-1] # Remove the first column which is not part of the encoding

## Add the encoded variables to the `meuse` dataframe
meuse <- cbind(meuse,df_one_hot)

```


5. Compute the variogram with the new universality conditions, fit a model and perform the kriging. Do the results improve ?

```{r}

```


# Maximum Likelihood estimation
Here we compute the maximum likelihood estimates of the following model for the log cadmium concentrations:
$$Cd(x) = \mu + Y(x)$$
where $Cd$ represents the log cadmium concentration, $\mu$ a constant mean and $Y$ a centered Gaussian random field. 

We will also consider models of the form:
$$Cd(x) = \mu(x) + Y(x)$$
where $\mu(x)$ may vary according to the location, e.g. $\mu(x) = X(x)\beta$ with $X$ an explanatory variable.

To do this, we use the **geoR** package. You may need to install it.

**geoR** uses a particular class to store spatial data sets : **geodata** (similar to a gstlearn db). The first thing is hence to transform our data in that class.

```{r}
library(geoR)
meuse.geoR = as.geodata(meuse, coords.col = 1:2, data.col = 3,covar.col = 8)
meuse.geoR$data = log(meuse.geoR$data)
meuse.geoR.grid = as.geodata(meuse.grid, coords.col = 1:2,covar.col = 5)
plot(meuse.geoR)
```

We can also compute variograms in **geoR**.

Omnidirectional
```{r}
vg <- variog(meuse.geoR, uvec = seq(0,2000,l=20), bin.cloud = T)
plot(vg)
```
Check for anisotropies
```{r}
vg.72 <- variog(meuse.geoR,uvec = seq(0,2000,l=20), direction = 72/180 * pi ,bin.cloud = T)
plot(vg.72)
```

Variogram of residuals
```{r}
vg.dist <- variog(meuse.geoR,uvec = seq(0,2000,l=20) ,trend = ~dist ,bin.cloud = T)
plot(vg.dist)
```


Then according to the covariance structure we want to infer (exponential by default), we can try something like this (see **?likfit** for more details)

```{r}
mean(log(meuse$cadmium))
var(log(meuse$cadmium))
ml = likfit(meuse.geoR, ini = c(0.5, 400), nug = 0.2)
summary(ml)
ml.dist = likfit(meuse.geoR, ini = c(0.5, 400), nug = 0.2,trend = trend.spatial(trend = ~dist ,meuse.geoR))
summary(ml.dist)
```

Likelihood ratio test
```{r}
T1.2 = 2 *(ml$loglik-ml.dist$loglik)
1-pchisq(T1.2,1)
```

We can represent the resulting fitting on the variogram

```{r}
plot(vg)
lines(vg.dist,col='red')
lines(ml)
lines(ml.dist,col='red')
```


## Prediction


We perform kriging with the **geoR** functions, on the grid and on the validation locations.

```{r}

k.grid = krige.conv(meuse.geoR,loc = meuse.geoR.grid$coords,krige = krige.control(obj.m=ml.dist,trend.d = trend.spatial(trend = ~dist,meuse.geoR), trend.l = trend.spatial(trend = ~dist.m,meuse.geoR.grid)))

```

Next we plot the resulting kriging and standard deviation maps.

```{r}
library(fields)
bubblePlot(meuse.grid$x, meuse.grid$y, k.grid$predict, asp=1)

bubblePlot(meuse.grid$x, meuse.grid$y, sqrt(k.grid$krige.var), asp=1)

```


6. Fit a model involving the *soil* and *freq* variables (as indicators). Perform a likelihood ratio test to ascertain their relevance. 

```{r}

```

7. Try using a Matern covariance model

# Comparison and interpretation

8. Compare the results obtained through variogram fitting and with `correlation()`. Interprete.

```{r}

```

9. Divide your dataset into two subsets: one for training, another for testing, possibly several times into a loop. Explain how you choose to build these two subsets and why.

```{r}
```

10. Interpolate `cadmium` on the entire target grid from the training data, using the various methods studied this week (OK, COK, UK, etc).

```{r}
```

11. Compare them on the test data. Which one would you pick and why ?

```{r}
```
