## Introduction

The **gstlearn** R package is a cross-platform R package wrapping the [gstlearn C++ Library](https://gstlearn.org) developed by the Geostatistics Team of the [Geosciences Research Center](https://www.geosciences.minesparis.psl.eu/). It is the successor of the [RGeostats R package](http://cg.ensmp.fr/rgeostats).

To install the **gstlearn** R Package, you need R 4.2 (or higher). You can then execute the following R command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("gstlearn",repos="https://soft.mines-paristech.fr/cran")
```

You will also need to install the following packages, which are used by the plot functions: ggplot2, vctrs, ggpubr, ggrepel, ggnewscale. You can do this by running the following command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages(c("ggplot2", "vctrs", "ggpubr", "ggrepel", "ggnewscale"))
```

Finally, you can install the **minigst** package from the provided archive file using this command:
```{r eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("./minigst_0.1.0.tar.gz",repos = NULL) #<- Change the path of the file if needed
```

## About C++ & R

* Remember that *gstlearn* is primarily a C++ package with a R interface: as such, R only sees *gstlearn* objects as pointers to their corresponding C++ object. The full list of C++ classes and functions is available on the *gstlearn* API [available here](https://soft.mines-paristech.fr/gstlearn/doxygen-latest/).

* You can access the methods of a C++ object using the `$` slot. For instance, if `db` is a Db object, the command `db$display()` calls the method `display` of the Db object. Note that when executing a method using the `$` slot, if you experience the following error...
```{r ,echo=FALSE}
base::message("Erreur dans validObject(.Object) : 
  objet de classe “MethodWithNext” incorrect: Error : C stack usage  7972404 is too close to the limit")
```

* If you need to duplicate your objects, a simple assignment (e.g. `db2 = db1`) is not possible. You must use the `clone` method by doing this: `db2 = db1$clone()`. (Otherwise you would just copy the pointer to the object)

* If you ask for the class type of a gstlearn object under R (e.g. class(mygrid)), you will obtain the C++ class name prefixed with ‘p’ (e.g. _p_DbGrid).
		

* The *gstlearn* objects memory content is not stored in the R workspace anymore. This means that saving the R workspace (`.RData`) is dangerous because it stores only memory pointers that won't be valid when loading the workspace in a future R session.

* People who want to recover the objects content for a future R session, have to save them to 'Neutral Files' using `dumpToNF` method before quitting R. All classes that inherits from `ASerializable` have this capability. 


## Loading the  package

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(minigst) #<- It will also load gstlearn, ggplot2,...
```


## The Db object

The Db objects are numerical data bases for spatial analysis. They can be seen as R dataframes with a geographical context, in the sense that they are numerical tables containing spatial coordinates and variables "measured" at these spatial coordinates.

To create a Db object, you can simply convert a R dataframe using the `dfToDb` function. Note that any strings in the original dataframe is converted to NA in the Db object, as Db objects can only contain numerical values.

```{r}
# Load Data
data("Scotland") # <- "Scotland" is a data frame stored in the minigst package
print(head(Scotland))

# Create Db object from the dataframe
db=dfToDb(df=Scotland, coordnames=c("Longitude", "Latitude"))

# Print summary of content
db$display()
```

Db objects can be manipulated just like R dataframes. Indeed, adding `[]` at the end of a Db object turns it into a dataframe.

```{r}
(class(db[]))
print(head(db[]))
```
For instance, you can extract some of the variables/columns from the Db using on of the following commands.

```{r}
## Extracts the variables "January_temp" and "Elevation" into a new dataframe
db[][c("January_temp","Elevation")]

## Extracts the lines 5 to 14 of the variable "Elevation"
db[][5:14,"Elevation"]

## Extracts the lines 5 to 14 of 4th column (i.e. "January_temp")
db[][5:14,4]
```

Note that you can also extract variables from a Db without explicitly turning your Db into a daraframe by just omitting the assessor `[]`. But then, misspecifying the variables won´t return an error, so be careful!

```{r}
## Extracts the variables "January_temp" and "Elevation" into a new dataframe
db[c("January_temp","Elevation")]

## Extracts the lines 5 to 14 of the variable "Elevation"
db[5:14,"Elevation"]

## Extracts the lines 5 to 14 of 4th column (i.e. "January_temp")
db[5:14,4]

## Try to extract a variable that does not exist
db["toto"] #-> Returns the whole Db as a dataframe
db[c("Elevation","toto")] #-> Returns only the variable "Elevation" since the other one does not exist

## You can use traditional regexp expressions
db["*temp"] #<- Extract all variables which name ends with "temp"

```

You can add new variables to a Db using the `addVarToDb` function.

```{r}
## Compute cos of coorditates
cosCoord=cos(db[][c("Longitude","Latitude")])

## Add them to the Db `db` under the names "cosLongitude","cosLatitude"
addVarToDb(db,var = cosCoord,vname = c("cosLongitude","cosLatitude"))

## Display Db
db

```

You can also delete variables from a Db using the `delVarFromDb` function.
```{r}
## Delete the variables "cosLongitude","cosLatitude" from the Db `db`
delVarFromDb(db,vname = c("cosLongitude","cosLatitude"))

## Display Db
db
```

You can plot the contents of a Db using function `dbplot_point` function (which relies on **ggplot2**). Note that the function returns a **ggplot** object and can therefore be associated with other **ggplot2** functions.  

```{r}
# Plot the variables Elevation (for the size of the points) and Longitude (for the color of the points)
dbplot_point(db=db,size="Elevation",color="Longitude",cmap="viridis")

# Store the plot, and then display it
plt=dbplot_point(db=db,size="Elevation",color="Longitude")
print(plt)
```
You can add points and lines to a **minigst** plot using the `addPoints` and `addLines` functions.
```{r}
# Create a plot of  the variable Elevation and store it in a variable `plt`
plt=dbplot_point(db=db,size="Elevation")

# Add to `plt` two triangular-shaped, orange points the plot at the coordinates (100,600) and (400,1100)
plt=addPoints(plt=plt,x=c(100,400),y=c(600,1100),color="orange", shape = 17, size = 3)

# Add `plt`  a red vertical line at the level v=300 to the plot
plt=addLines(plt=plt,v=300,color="red")

# Display the plot `plt`
print(plt)
```

## The DbGrid object

The DbGrid objects are derived from Db objects, and are aimed at storing data that located on a regular grid. 

To create a DbGrid object (from scratch), you can use the `createDbGrid` function.

```{r}
# Define grid points
ngrid=100 # Number of points in each dimension of the grid
xseq=seq(from=0,to=1,length.out=ngrid) # Coordinates of the grid points in the x-axis
yseq=seq(from=0,to=1,length.out=ngrid) # Coordinates of the grid points in the y-axis

# Create DbGrid
dbG=createDbGrid(coords=list(xseq,yseq),coordnames=c("xcoord", "ycoord"))
dbG

# Alternative way of creating the same DbGrid
dbG=createDbGrid(nx=c(ngrid,ngrid),dx=c(1/(ngrid-1),1/(ngrid-1)),x0=c(0,0))
dbG

```
Alternatively, you can convert a R dataframe using the `dfToDbGrid` function (or the `dfToDb` function with the `isGrid=TRUE` argument). 

```{r}
# Load Grid data
data("ScotlandGrid") # <- "ScotlandGrid" is a data frame stored in the minigst package
print(head(ScotlandGrid))

# Create DbGrid from dataframe
dbG=dfToDbGrid(df=ScotlandGrid,coordnames=c("Longitude","Latitude"))
dbG

```

Since DbGrid objects are also Db objects, extracting, adding and deleting variables can be done in the same way. As for plotting, you should now use the function `dbplot_grid` (instead of `dbplot_point`).
```{r}
# Plot the variable Elevation by color using the "RdBu" palette
dbplot_grid(dbG,color="Elevation",cmap = "RdBu")

# Plot the variable Elevation by contour 
dbplot_grid(dbG,contour="Elevation",cmap = "RdBu",nLevels = 15)

```

As before, you can add lines, points and even plots of additional Db objects into a single plot.

```{r}
# Create plot of the variable Elevation in the DbGrid `dbG` (by color using the "RdBu" palette)
# And store it into a variable `plt`
plt=dbplot_grid(dbG,color="Elevation",cmap = "RdBu")

# Add to `plt` two triangular-shaped, orange points the plot at the coordinates (100,600) and (400,1100)
plt=addPoints(plt=plt,x=c(100,400),y=c(600,1100),color="orange", shape = 17, size = 3)

# Add to `plt`  a red vertical line at the level v=300 to the plot
plt=addLines(plt=plt,v=300,color="red")

# Add to `plt` a plot of the variable "January_temp" in the Db object `db` created earlier
plt=dbplot_point(db=db,size="January_temp",sizeRange = c(0.25,3),add=plt)

# Display the plot
print(plt)

```

## Selection

You can add a mask/selection to a Db or DbGrid object to mask off part of the points in the database. Once specified, any function (eg. plotting) applied to the Db will only be applied to the active/selected samples. This can be done with the function `addSel` which expects a binary variables specify which samples should be kept. You can remove a selection by just calling the function `clearSel`.


```{r}
## Display and plot the Db (before adding the selection)
dbG
dbplot_grid(dbG,color="Longitude")

## Create binary variable equal to 1 when the variable "Longitude" of `dbG` is greater than 250
binarySel=dbG["Longitude"]>250

## Add selection
addSel(dbG,binarySel)

## Display Db  (after adding the selection)
dbG
dbplot_grid(dbG,color="Longitude")

## Remove selection
clearSel(dbG)

## Display Db (after removing the selection)
dbG
dbplot_grid(dbG,color="Longitude")

```

## Exercise

We start by loading the data from the `sp` package. We load two data frames:

  * `meuse` is a R dataframe containing metal concentrations measured along the Meuse river in France. It contains the following variables:
    -   **x** and **y**: easting and northing (m) coordinates
    -   **cadmium**, **copper**, **lead**, **zinc**: topsoil heavy metal concentrations (ppm) (NB: obtained from composite samples **15m x 15m**)
    -   **elev**: relative elevation above the river (m)
    -   **dist**: distance to the river (normalized between 0 and 1)
    -   **om**, **soil**, **lime**: soil characteristics (content of organic matter, type of soil, presence of lime)
    -   **ffreq**: flooding frequency class: 1 = once in two years; 2 = once in ten years; 3 = one in 50 years
    -   **landuse**: landuse classes
    -   **dist.m**: distance to the river (m)
    
  * `meuse.grid` is a R dataframe containing describing a grid covering the Meuse river (and the samples in the `meuse` dataframe). It contains the following variables:
    -   **x** and **y**: easting and northing (m) coordinates
    -   **dist**: distance to the river (normalized between 0 and 1)
    -   **soil**: soil characteristics (content of organic matter, type of soil, presence of lime)
    -   **ffreq**: flooding frequency class: 1 = once in two years; 2 = once in ten years; 3 = one in 50 years
    -   **part.a, part.b**: arbitrary division of the area in two areas, a and b

```{r }
library(sp,warn.conflicts = F) # load library
data(meuse) # load data
data(meuse.grid) # load target grid
```


1. Create a Db object from the Meuse dataset (dataframe `meuse`). Remember to set the correct variables as coordinates.

2. Add the log-concentrations of metals to the Db.

3. Compute basic statistics of each heavy metal log-concentration (see the function `summaryStats`)

4. Plot each heavy metal log-concentration. 

5. Plot each heavy metal log-concentration, but only the samples with a distance to the river smaller that 0.25. 

6. Create a **DbGrid** from the Meuse dataset (dataframe `meuse.grid`). Remember to set the correct variables as coordinates.

7. Plot the map of soil characteristics from the resulting DbGrid (use the argument `cat_color` in the `dbplot_grid` function).
